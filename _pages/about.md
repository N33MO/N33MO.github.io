Greetings! I am a CS PhD student in Texas State University. I joined the program in 2023 Spring. Previously I worked as a SDE at Amazon on Alexa devices. I did my master's degree at University at Texas at Dallas from 2019 to 2021.

My research interest is Green Computing, where I strive to find more eco-friendly implementation of software programs. My advisor is <a href='https://userweb.cs.txstate.edu/~zz11/'>Prof. Zong</a>.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
